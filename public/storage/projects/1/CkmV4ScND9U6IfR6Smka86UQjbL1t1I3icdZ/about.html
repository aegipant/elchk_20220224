			<div class="" data-ar-id="djJLfBMYCj">During the 10 years from 2000 to 2010, we have encountered various problems during the lead time for the Academy - from the opposition regarding the proposed building location at Ping Shan by the locals to the suspension of the whole project as decided by the Education Bureau due to decreasing birth rate - and yet we do not give up our faith of creating a new school with an epochal curriculum for our young generations. Eventually in 2008 the Legislative Council has accepted and approved the School Development Project. A sum of around HK$280 million dollars has been granted for building the school premise and it has been ready for use since 2010.<br data-ar-id="aaZjmtGYBA"><br data-ar-id="KQWfaWqQbh">
			With the concerted effort of the LA team and the unanimous support from the LA community, we achieved a great milestone for the Academy by successfully gaining the IB authorization to offer the Diploma Programme (DP) in September 2014, the Primary Years Programme (PYP) in January 2018, and the Middle Years Programme in November 2019 respectively, which made us the first and only Direct Subsidy Scheme through-train school in the Northwestern New Territories of Hong Kong.

				There are only limited metered parking space outside the school, and illegal parking would be charged by the police. In view of this, we strongly suggest parents or visitors taking public transportation to come to the school, especially during large-scale events. In case you have an inevitable need to come by private cars, you can consider using the parking meter or the car parks nearby.
